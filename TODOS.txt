 Future possibilities without a DB

If desired later:

Harmonization (build chords from scales)

Progression suggestions based on key

MIDI pattern generation

Scale degree conversions (1 → tonic, 4 → subdominant)

All algorithmic — still no database required.




so now i build chords by getting index fromall the NOTES array. problem is if example ask for Cdom7 it gives me C E F A# when it should give me Bb not A# 
can i say something like if dom7 is the type, then  NOTES[noteIndex].name = NOTES[noteIndex].enharmonic

better yet, dominant 7's are always = lowering the 7th. this would mean that every chord type where the noteIndex === 10 we should choose the enharmonic name of the note instead of 
the default name of the note

consider not allowing scales that are different when descending

chromatic scale a little weird in how it is displayed, fix later
