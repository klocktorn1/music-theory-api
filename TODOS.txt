 Future possibilities without a DB

If desired later:

Harmonization (build chords from scales)

Progression suggestions based on key

MIDI pattern generation

Scale degree conversions (1 → tonic, 4 → subdominant)

All algorithmic — still no database required.




so now i build chords by getting index fromall the NOTES array. problem is if example ask for Cdom7 it gives me C E F A# when it should give me Bb not A# 
can i say something like if dom7 is the type, then  NOTES[noteIndex].name = NOTES[noteIndex].enharmonic

better yet, dominant 7's are always = lowering the 7th. this would mean that every chord type where the noteIndex === 10 we should choose the enharmonic name of the note instead of 
the default name of the note

consider not allowing scales that are different when descending

chromatic scale a little weird in how it is displayed, fix later

fix P8/P1 in intervals data, need a better fix

i need to be able to generate a chromatic scale with CORRECT theoretical enharmonic notes for each note available. The rules should be the following: the degrees are     
    0: "1",
    1: "b2",
    2: "2",
    3: "b3",
    4: "3",
    5: "4",
    6: "b5",
    7: "5",
    8: "b6",
    9: "6",
    10: "b7",
    11: "7",
which would mean in C: C is 0 since D is 2 in C the b2 = Db since we are lowering the second degree. This would apply for every scale. So Cb for instance Cb Db Eb ... the b2 would have to be Dbb since we are lowering the second degree. in C# it would be C# D# E# ... the b2 would be D since we are lowering the second degree. i need every key to follow these rules.
